    This change adds functionality to enable modular libvirt daemons
    support. Also all the daemons runs in separate containers, so the
    configuration is done for all the daemon containers.
    Here is the list of daemons added in this change.
    - virtnodedevd
    - virtproxyd
    - virtqemud
    - virtsecretd
    - virtstoraged

    More information regarding modular libvirt daemons is available here.
