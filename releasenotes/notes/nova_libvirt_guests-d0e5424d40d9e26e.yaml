    New profile to configure libvirt-guests on compute host. On compute
    shutdown we might want to gracefully shutdown instances using
    libvirt-guests. If it gets configured is managed with the tht
    NovaResumeGuestsStateOnHostBoot parameter. This triggers config of
    /etc/sysconfig/libvirt-guests via puppet-nova, configures a dependency
    for virt-guest-shutdown.target to the docker service that instances get
    shutdown before the libvirt container gets stopped.
