    libvirt 6.8.0 introduces virt-ssh-helper which prepends the libvirt
    ssh command with a "which virt-ssh-helper". libvirt used to first
    check for `nc` (netcat). But these two libvirt commits[1][2] have now
    changed it to first look for `virt-ssh-helper`, if it not available,
    then fall back to `nc`. This trips up the 'nova-migration-wrapper' as
    it does not support virt-ssh-helper atm.
    Until this is implemented, this change force to use "netcat" (`nc`) by
    appending to the migration URI: "&proxy=netcat"
