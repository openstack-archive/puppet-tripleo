    The memcached IP for the Swift object expirer is not properly set in case
    of separate storage nodes.  Until now, these were only set if the Swift
    proxy node was also configured on the same node; however, this is not the
    case with separate storage nodes. The service would still run, but was not
    able to use any cache and logging errors therefore.
