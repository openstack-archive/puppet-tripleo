features:
  - |
    Add `haproxy_lb_mode_longrunning` parameter for the use with the services
    that may have longrunning API requests. Defaults to 'leastconn' (replaces
    the HAProxy default 'roundrobin').
upgrade:
  - |
    Since Heat API can be given longrunning API requests its backends will
    become load-balanced based on LRU 'leastconn' algorithm and its sessions
    will also benefit from the TCP-keepalive feature of HAProxy.
