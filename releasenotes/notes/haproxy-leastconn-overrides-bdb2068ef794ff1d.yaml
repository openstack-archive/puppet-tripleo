    Since Heat API can be given longrunning API requests its backends will
    become load-balanced based on LRU 'leastconn' algorithm and its sessions
    will also benefit from the TCP-keepalive feature of HAProxy.

    Some of the other services with the longrunning requests notion will start
    using the 'leastconn' LRU LB as well.
