    This change introduces two hiera keys that allow an operator to specify
    which NIC (or NICs) the VIPs will be bound to. One hiera key has global effect
    (tripleo::pacemaker::force_nic) and forces all VIPs to listen to that NIC.
    There is also the possibility to override that for specific VIPs with the
    force_vip_nic_overrides hiera hash.
    This change is only useful for deployments where BGP is used to advertise
    IP addresses from the host across multiple L3 networks.
