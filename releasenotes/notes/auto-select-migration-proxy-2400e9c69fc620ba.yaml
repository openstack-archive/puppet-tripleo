    When support for CentOS stream  9 and rhel 9 was being developed the
    nova migration wrapper script in the RDO distgit repo did not support
    the virt-ssh-helper command for live migration. To work around that
    the netcat proxy was hardcoded in 04a97f92e4d944ce51492011584e2ec1126042a1.
    Since then the nova-distgit repo has been updated with support for
    virt-ssh-helper and netcat has been removed from the nova live migration
    target container. As a result its not currently possible to live migrate
    with rhel9 images As reported in `bugzilla 2089520`_. To support upgrades
    this has now been reverted and we no longer hardcode the proxy to netcat.
